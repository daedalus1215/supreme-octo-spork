# To direct traffic we need to create a target group and listener. 
# Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets 
# (in our case, containers). When you create each listener rule, you specify a 
# target group and conditions. Traffic is then forwarded to the corresponding 
# target group. Create these with the following:

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "target_group" {
  name        = "target-group"
  port        = 80
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  target_type = "ip"
  vpc_id      = "${aws_default_vpc.default_vpc.id}" # Referencing the default VPC
  health_check {
    matcher = "200,301,302"
    path = "/"
  }
}

resource "aws_lb_listener" "listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = "${aws_alb.application_load_balancer.arn}" # Referencing our load balancer
  port              = "80"
  protocol          = "HTTP"
  default_action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = "${aws_lb_target_group.target_group.arn}" # Referencing our tagrte group
  }
}
